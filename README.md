# Class Repository For Autumn 2018 PYTHON210B Programming in Python course (Bellevue class)

UWPCE Python Certificate Program

This repository is used by the class to share information and for students to submit their work.

## Structure of the Repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

* `examples`: Used to store example code and example documents for the class.

* `solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises.

* `students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create a directory, then store work for each exercise in a subdirectory of that.

## For Students

If you are a student in the class, you should create a fork of this repo, add your work to your fork, and use Pull Requests to submit your work for review:
